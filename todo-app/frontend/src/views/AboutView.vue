    <h1>AWS Todo</h1>
    <p>
      In this tutorial series, weâ€™ll build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
      Delete) todo list application, starting with a basic version deployed on a
      single EC2 instance. As we progress, we will incrementally scale the
      application by integrating advanced AWS services and best practices,
      gradually transforming it into a cloud-native solution with high
      availability, security, and scalability. Each version will introduce new
      features and enhancements, focusing on different AWS technologies, helping
      you not only learn about application development but also about deploying
      and managing applications in the AWS ecosystem.
